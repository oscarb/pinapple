## Requesting a feature

1. Filter the [issues](https://github.com/oscarb/pinapple/issues) to see if the request hasn't already been added. If it has, add a :+1: to it.
2. Create a new issue and describe your request as a _user story_. 
3. If it is something completely new to the latest release, please include _feature-request_ in your description. Otherwise include _enhancement_ somewhere in your description.

A [user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) can be on the template: 

> As a _[type of user]_, I want _[some goal]_ so that _[some reason]_.
